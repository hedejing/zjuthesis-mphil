Line rendering is an important method to depict the shape of an object concisely. Stereo line rendering, a combination of line rendering and stereo rendering, not only efficiently conveys shape but also provides users with a stereoscopic visual experience. Among the lines discussed in the field of line rendering, contours and suggestive contours are the most important lines. However, contours and suggestive contours must be rendered consistently for two eyes because of their view-dependent nature; otherwise, they cause binocular rivalry and viewing discomfort. This thesis proposes a novel solution to draw stereo-consistent view-dependent lines in real time. First, we extend the concept of epipolar-slidability and derive a new criterion to check epipolar-slidability by the monotonicity of the trajectory of the viewpoints of contour points. Then, we design an algorithm to test the epipolar-slidability of contour points by conducting an image space search rather than sampling multiple viewpoints in a previous work. The derivation and algorithm mentioned above are applicable to suggestive contours as well. Results show that the proposed method has a much lower cost than that of previous works, therefore enables the real-time rendering and editing of stereo-consistent contours and suggestive contours, such as changing camera viewpoints, editing object geometry, tweaking parameters to show contours with different details, etc.
